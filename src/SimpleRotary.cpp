	SET DEBOUNCE DELAY
	Sets the debounce delay time in milliseconds.
	
	This number shold be set as small as possible. Higher values can result in missing input pulses.
	Finding this value will vary from one rotary encoder to another and can be found simply with
	trial and error.
	
	You can turn this feature off by setting the delay value to 0.

/**
	SET ERROR CORRECTION DELAY
	Sets the error correction delay delay time in milliseconds.
	
	Setting a higher number here will result in smoother direction values at the cost of being able to quickly change directions. For example, setting a value of 250ms will require a the user to pause 1/4 second between changing direction of the rotary encoder. It takes most users longer then 250ms to reorient their fingers to the new direction so in most cases this would be fine. If a user was to change direction of the rotary encoder faster then 1/4 of a second then the output value would be the previous direction. This number should be set to whatever delay works best for your application.
